Go to my-app folder to view the public and src folders
In src folder you can view the JS, JSX and SCSS files

As the instructions given, I haven't used CSS and it's frameworks, rather I went and styled using SASS.

To mention, I have used pagination to restrict the view so that only 4 profiles can be seen per page, and have create three pages.
Have used List Users API from reqres to fetch. Added the search bar so that user can search the details of particulars. As, mentioned I have added modal(React-Modal) to the list of every profile,(placed avatar on the right side of the modal) when clicked, you can view the details of particular profile in the same page. The app is responsive, the view fits for mobile and laptops as well.

Kindly, write me back if you have an queries regarding this.

Thank you!
